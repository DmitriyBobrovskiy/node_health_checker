# Considerations
* I did not add DI (Dependency Injection) - that'd be definitely a plus to have it for testability and improvability, but for test task scope can be omitted
* as far as I understand it's more common for Node.js to follow Functional Paradigm, but I personally prefer OOP, that's why I follow OOP style here
* min and max borders of entropy multiplier could be put to config as well, but decided to not do this for simplicity
* I did not think of architecture that much - it definitely can be done better, just didn't want to spend a lot of time on this for such a simple service
* 

# TODO: 
* add DI
* add web server
* add reports generation (HTML)
